# Features
You are probably wondering why you should join this smp, rather than any other aternos SMP.
- We offer 24/7 hosting, around the clock with no inturruptions apart from schedualed maintence
- This server is hosted locally which means we can provide extremely low ping levels, ranging from 0ms to 40ms. This allows for extremely smooth PvP and gameplay
- Our server also has a payed anticheat, Vulcan, which is the best anti-cheat out there, and anybody who get's caught cheating is instantly banned
- We use a premium desktop PC to host our server, providing for a solid 20 TPS no matter what players are doing on the server
- We use PaperMC to run our server, a type of server optimized so it can withstand even the biggest of lag machines, and updated right after a new dupe or glitch is found
